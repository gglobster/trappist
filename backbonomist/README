This project consists of a library of packages and a main script that can be
run as a pipeline. The pipeline script is designed to take a reference genome
segment, search unfinished query genomes to identify matching contigs and
scaffold them against the reference.

The primary application it was designed for is to identify plasmid contigs in
unfinished microbial genomes and producing tentative assemblies.

This replaces an older project that did the job but was unnecessarily complex
in its design.

STATUS: The code is operational up to scaffold production and annotation. It
does require setting up some files and config parameters manually. This
procedure is not yet described in the documentation.

As of 17 Mar 2012 development is in testing/application phase.

A feature that is desired but not currently on the list of next steps is:

- GUI for loading in the initial dataset and configuring parameters
